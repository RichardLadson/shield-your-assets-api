- Age: 78 years old
- State: Florida (FL)
- Marital Status: Widowed (single)
- Veteran: Yes
- Health Status: Declining with Parkinson's Disease
- In facility for 60 days
- Has Long-Term Care Insurance

**Financial Summary:**

  - Social Security: $1,800
  - Pension: $500
  - Rental Income: $1,200
  - Investment Income: $100

- Countable Assets: ~$90,000 (bank accounts + investments)
- Non-Countable Assets: ~$395,000 (home + rental property + personal property)
- Total Assets: $485,000

**Key Differences from California Scenario:**
1. Single/Widowed (no spouse strategies)
2. Florida state (different Medicaid rules)
3. Lower assets (closer to eligibility)
4. Has rental income
5. Veteran status
6. Has LTC insurance

## Expected Strategies (Different from California)

### 1. **Rental Property Strategy**
- **Description**: Transfer rental property to income-producing trust or sell to reduce countable assets
- **Why Different**: Maria has rental property generating income, which California scenario didn't have
- **Effectiveness**: High
- **Timing**: Should be evaluated immediately

### 2. **Veterans Benefits Coordination**
- **Description**: Coordinate VA Aid & Attendance benefits with Medicaid planning
- **Why Different**: Maria is a veteran, previous scenario was not
- **Effectiveness**: High
- **Timing**: Can apply for VA benefits while planning for Medicaid

### 3. **Long-Term Care Insurance Utilization**
- **Description**: Maximize LTC insurance benefits before Medicaid application
- **Why Different**: Maria has LTC insurance, previous scenario did not
- **Effectiveness**: High
- **Timing**: Use immediately to delay Medicaid need

### 4. **Florida-Specific Income Trust (NOT needed)**
- **Why Different**: Florida is an income cap state, but Maria's income ($3,800) is below Florida's limit
- **Note**: No Miller Trust/QIT needed unlike high-income scenarios

### 5. **Home Equity Protection**
- **Description**: Ensure home remains exempt asset with intent to return
- **Why Different**: Maria intends to return home (previous scenario did not)
- **Effectiveness**: High
- **Timing**: Document intent to return immediately

## Strategies NOT Expected (Were in California)

### ❌ **Community Spouse Resource Allowance**
- Not applicable - Maria is widowed

### ❌ **Spousal Transfer**
- Not applicable - no spouse

### ❌ **High Asset Conversion**
- Less emphasis as Maria is closer to eligibility threshold

## Florida-Specific Considerations

1. **Income Cap State**: Florida has strict income limits ($2,829 for 2025)
2. **Lower Asset Limits**: $2,000 for single person
3. **Estate Recovery**: More aggressive than California
4. **VA Benefits**: Can be coordinated with Medicaid

## Expected Eligibility Assessment

- **Resource Eligible**: No (has ~$90,000 countable, limit is $2,000)
- **Income Eligible**: No (has $3,800, limit is $2,829)
- **Excess Resources**: ~$88,000
- **Strategies Needed**: Yes, but less aggressive than high-asset scenario
